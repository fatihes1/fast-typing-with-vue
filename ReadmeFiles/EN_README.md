This project created an application that aims to increase the keyboard typing speed. By typing the words that appear on the screen, it aims to show how many words you have written in a minute and how many are correct. After typing the word, it is passed to the next word with the space key. The words are taken from TDK (Turkish Language Institution).

 ## Technologies

#### **Vue.js Web Framework**
Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like **view**) is a **progressive framework** for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.
